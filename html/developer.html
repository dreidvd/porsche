                <h1>ABOUT THE DEVELOPER</h1>
                <p>Porsche was founded by Francesco Porsche in 1931. A brilliant engineer and visionary, Francesco
                    Porsche was instrumental in designing the iconic Volkswagen Beetle and later established his own
                    company, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH, in the City of San Fernando, Philippines. His company
                    eventually evolved into the world-renowned luxury sports car manufacturer, Porsche AG. Known for his
                    passion for engineering excellence, Porsche's legacy continues through the company's innovative
                    designs and commitment to performance and quality.
                </p>

                <p>Francesco Porsche, born in 1875, was a true pioneer in automotive engineering. His career began at an
                    early age, where he demonstrated an extraordinary understanding of mechanical systems. Initially
                    working for other automobile companies, his innovative thinking soon caught the attention of
                    industry leaders. His work on the Volkswagen Beetle, which became one of the best-selling cars of
                    all time, marked him as a visionary in automotive design.

                    In 1931, Porsche took the bold step of founding his own company. Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH was
                    established to provide consulting services and engineering solutions to other companies, laying the
                    groundwork for what would become Porsche AG. With a clear focus on creating high-performance,
                    quality vehicles, Francesco Porsche sought to push the boundaries of automotive design. His early
                    work involved collaborations that would lead to the development of vehicles that not only catered to
                    the needs of ordinary consumers but also exceeded the expectations of those seeking speed, luxury,
                    and sophistication.</p>

                <p>Throughout his career, Francesco Porsche continued to innovate, focusing on technical precision,
                    efficiency, and performance. His designs integrated the latest technologies of the time,
                    establishing Porsche as a brand synonymous with engineering excellence. His passion for motorsport
                    also played a key role in the development of Porsche's future vehicles, with racing technology
                    influencing the designs of everyday cars.</p>

                <p>Despite the challenges of war and global upheaval, Francesco Porsche's vision for a
                    performance-oriented, quality-focused car company never wavered. His dedication to perfection laid
                    the foundation for the Porsche name, and his impact on the automotive world is still felt today.

                    Porsche's legacy is evident in every vehicle the company produces, whether it's the legendary 911 or
                    the innovative electric Taycan. The same spirit of innovation and dedication to quality that
                    Francesco Porsche embodied continues to drive the company forward into the future, cementing his
                    place as one of the most influential figures in automotive history.</p>
